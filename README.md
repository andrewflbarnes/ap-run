# andrewandpenny.run

This is a minimal static website for whatever big run Penny and I have planned (if any!).

The page gives a description of the challenge at the top, a link to a donation page, strava
widgets to track training and a table of the current sweepstake.

There is also a sticky footer donation button.

### Local deployment

Start the mock sweepstake server
```bash
npm -i -g json-server
cd mock && json-server
```

Then open static/index.html in your favourite browser - simples :)
